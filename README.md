![iris-dataset](https://github.com/john-ml-dev/iris_dataset/assets/78201996/79da95f4-c81d-4fce-8388-4256559f1fc2)

The dataset used in this project is the famous iris dataset from the Sklearn datasets. 
The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers [Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica]. 
The columns represent the measurement of each flower's Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.
Using KNN classifier, the goal is to predict the type of iris flower given its sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width

# Outcome
The model predicted the type of iris flower with **90%** accuracy
